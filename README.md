# Dimad

DIMAD is a program which studies particle behavior in circular machines and in
beamlines. The trajectories of the particles are computed according to the second order
matrix formalism.

DIMAD does not provide synchrotron motion analysis but can
simulate it. The program provides the user with the possibility of defining
arbitrary elements to tailor the program to specific uses. The present version of
DIMAD is not fully debugged.

## Usage

Please see the [documentation](https://dimad-org.github.io/) for usage information.

## Examples

See the [demos](/demos) directory for some examples.

## History

DIMAD,like its predecessor DIMAT, is the result of many years of experimenting
with several different charged particle computer codes.
In 1970 the first author had the good fortune of discovering the program
OSECO (_Optique du SECond Ordre_) written by J.L.LACLARE at SACLAY.
